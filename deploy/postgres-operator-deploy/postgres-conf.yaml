  # This bash script is run once, the 1st time a Primary PostgreSql container is created. It is run in the Primary container only.
  #
  # You can edit this script as it suits your requirement. For example, you could add SQL statements to create specific
  # database(s), user(s), grant accesses, etc...
  # See the commented examples in the script below.
  #
  # This script will be located in the container folder "/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d"
  # That folder is referenced in the Postgres Docker page: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres
  #
  # If you edit the script in this file, your changes will apply to all Kubegres resources.
  # Alternatively, you can override it for your Kubegres resource. To do so, create a custom configMap and in your
  # Kubegres resource file set its name in 'spec.customConfig'. In your ConfigFile, copy the contents of this script
  # and edit it as its suits your requirement.
